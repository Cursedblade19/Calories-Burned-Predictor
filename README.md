# Calories-Burned-Predictor

The Calories Burnt Prediction project aims to develop a model that can predict the number of calories a person can burn depending on various factors. 
•Analyze the data and create new features from it that can improve the model’s performance, such as body mass index or activity intensity 
•Split the data into training and testing datasets and use it to train your chosen model
•Evaluate the performance of your model using appropriate metrics 
•Optimize the model’s hyperparameters to improve its performance 
•Integrate the model with a simple web application to allow users to provide input and receive predictions on the number of calories burned
